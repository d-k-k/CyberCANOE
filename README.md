##About
The **Unity CyberCANOE Package** allows you to setup Unity projects for the Innovator-class and Destiny-class CyberCANOE in the Laboratory for Advanced Visualizations and Applications at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Innovator-class CyberCANOE includes a flat tiled display wall with 8160x1152 pixels of stereoscopic resolution, a 6-degree of freedom head and wand tracking system, and a surround sound speaker system.

The Destiny-class CyberCANOE provides 16X the resolution of Innovator as well as significantly improved image quality due to its use of OLED displays rather than LCDs. The system is also driven by 8 PCs each with a GeForce 980 graphics card, effectively giving it 4X the graphics capacity of Innovator.  The 8 PCs work together in a cluster rendering setup that allows the PCs to display the same scene in-sync with each other.
